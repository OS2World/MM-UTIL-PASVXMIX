                    PASVXMIX V0.9
is a Mixer for the Pro Audio Spectrum 16 sound card.
----------------------------------------------------
          Programmed by Patrick Premont

----------------------------------------------------

This program has been done in two days and is
intended as a quick fix for the fact that the
PAS mixer for PM doesn't allow you to save
its settings. With PASVXMIX, you can load & save the
settings and the savefiles are scripts that
can configure the PAS. So one of these scripts is
placed in your startup folder and configures
the card at boot time without launching PASVXMIX.
The program is rather slow however because it
acts through the PAS.EXE command-line program.

Installing it:
--------------
PASVXMIX requires the VX-REXX runtime library and
PAS.EXE, a small command-line program to change the
settings of the PAS 16.

PAS.EXE can be retreived from ftp.cdrom.com
in /pub/os2/2_x/mmedia/setpas16.zip

PAS.EXE must placed in a directory which in your
PATH so that the PAS command can be launched
from anywhere. This in turn makes it possible
to launch the scripts produced by PASVXMIX
from anywhere. The scripts are the files
used by PASVXMIX to save the volume levels and
options. They include calls to the PAS command
that configure the PAS-16 to the levels in that
savefile so the can be launched without starting
PASVXMIX.EXE.

The VX-REXX runtime library is the file VROBJ.DLL
which is included in the distribution of PASVXMIX.
It must be placed in a directory which is in your
LIBPATH. (Defined in your config.sys file)
The current directory is a simple choice (it
should be in your LIBPATH).

If you want the boot settings to be set every
time you boot, run "Install_boot_settings.cmd".

Using it:
---------
I hope its use is obvious except for the
following details.
In PASVXMIX, the checkbox are use to disable
level control. It is equivalent to setting the
level to zero but allow a quick on/off toggle.
The "Stereo Channels" setting selects the
channel(s) which are the target of the level
modifications made with the other controls.
They are NOT on/off switches for channels.
If you want to turn off the left Mic channel,
select Left and then uncheck the Mic box.

               LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------------------------------
PASVXMIX is freeware. You may use and copy any part
of the distribution except VROBJ.DLL which you
can only use with PASVXMIX. This restriction is
because Watcom gives me the right to redistribute
VROBJ.DLL but it must be distibuted only as part of
my program. I accept no legal responsabilty for the
behavior of this program and must, in accordance
with VROBJ.DLL's redistribution rights, indemnify, hold
harmless and defend WATCOM and its suppliers (and
myself by the way) from and against any claims or
lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or
result from the use or distribution of PASVXMIX.
